	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Intro ✨</td> <td> A simple window that can help The User </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Sprites ✅</td> <td> game assets </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Player 🎮 </td> <td> the Player that you can use throughout the game. 🐭 (jerry) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Collectible 🌟</td> <td> coins that you should eat to open the door </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Walls 🧱</td> <td> the closed space in the game </td>
